# CodeAlpha_internship
## Intern: [Adeel Khan]
Welcome to my Code Alpha Internship Tasks Repository! This README file provides details about the tasks assigned to me during my internship at Code Alpha.
### Task Submission

I have organized my tasks in the following structure:

- Each task is stored in a separate folder with a meaningful name (i-e Task1).
- Code files are named according to the functionality, for example, `add-recepie.php`.

### Acknowledgments

I would like to express my appreciation to the Code Alpha  team and my teachers for the valuable learning experience provided during this internship.
Thank you for reviewing my work!
Best regards,
Adeel Khan
